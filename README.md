# Roblox-Plugins
A collection of Roblox plugins I've developed!

# Building
To build a plugin in this repository, make sure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) installed with one of the folders in this repository opened as the workspace.
You will also need the [Rojo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo) extension installed and enabled.
From there you can press `Ctrl + Shift + B` and the plugin should be deployed to Roblox Studio's Plugins folder!
